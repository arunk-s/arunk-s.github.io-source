Summary: The first post on blog  

This is the first time I am writing for a blog of myself and this is a great feeling, not that I haven't written essays, articles, summaries and all that stuff in my high school, writing for yourself,to express yourself and that can be read by anyone in the world is a totally different thing. I've been planning to blog ever since I started reading more stuff online than my regular studies (I don't remember when). But the time passes by and I just hung onto other things and my blog didn't happen for a long time.

But a while back, I went into our college's open source meet and there I've made an attempt to made an static blog for the club. That blog was live in two hours without much fuss and that felt brilliant, just write a markdown and your post is ready. That felt like something that I could hung on to. So I decided to use some static site generator and make my own blog.

But again, deciding to have a blog and making that happen took some time until my awaited long holidays happened.
So I started searching the static site generators for one that is suitable for me as there are so many great options out there.
I chose pelican for no good reason, it's just that I've touched more python than ruby and I don't want to be ignorant of what's going under the hood.

So here it is, my first post on my own blog.   
Thank you for reading this far, I am looking forward to having a great journey ahead.  
Peace Folks!
