Title: About Me

Hey!  
I am Arun, a 19 year old engineering (CS Major) student in India.   
I am a simple seeker,tinkerer and a linux-fan who loves to code. I am always ready to learn new stuff and make cool things. I like to read about technology and I love the nitty-gritty details. I am still in process of discovering my interests and I try to reach out for more.   

Currently, I know C/C++, Python, some shell-scripting and nowadays I am learning GO. I am into systems programming and backend application development (or anything that involves low-level, behind the scenes work).  
You got something cool to work on or you want to build something, I am all in, you can reach me at [arunsori94@gmail.com](mailto:arunsori94@gmail.com). 

You are here, so you want to know what will I blog about...there are no specifics now.
But I will write on any interesting tech, linux, How-tos, tips n tricks that adds to your arsenal and random thoughts and more.  
Sounds interesting! keep an eye over here. ;)
